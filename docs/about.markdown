## Biography

I am a undergraduate student at [School of the Gifted Young](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn), the Honours college at [University of Science and Technology China](https://ustc.edu.cn). I am widely interested in computer hardwares(GPU, FPGA, ASIC, etc.) and deep learning algorithms, especially on efficient deep learning. I was advised by Prof. [Chao Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cswang/) at USTC and Prof. [Zhenman Fang](http://www.sfu.ca/~zhenman/) at SFU. I am currently advised by Prof. [Yingyan Lin](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/yingyan-lin), working on efficient Deep Learning.

## Research Experiences

#### **Research Intern, [EIC-LAB](https://eiclab.net/), Rice University**

*2021.08 - present*

+ Advised by Prof. [Yingyan Lin](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/yingyan-lin)(Assistant Professor at USTC)

+ Visualized and analyzed sparsity patterns in a large variaty of Vision Models (ResNet, MobileNet, ViTs, MLP-Mixer, etc.)

+ Identified how the choice of activation functions can affect the sparsity of activations

+ Brainstormed and planned to accelerate sparse deep learning models on a heterogeneous hardware system

+ Also learned some other topics on System for ML: High Performance Computing for ML workload, compiler for ML

#### **Summer Research Intern, [HiAccel Lab](http://www.sfu.ca/~zhenman/index.html), Simon Fraser University**

*2021.02 - 2021.10*

+ Advised by Prof. [Zhenman Fang](http://www.sfu.ca/~zhenman/index.html)(Assistant Professor at SFU), sponsored by [Mitacs Scholarship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink)

+ Developed an algorithm to automatically generate the accelerator design for stencil kernels using HLS C++ with Vitis HLS flow

+ Took advantage of both temporal and spatial parallelism, and exploited the high memory bandwidth of HBM banks

+ Implemented stencil algorithms on Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA board with the speed 2.43 times faster than the state-of-the-art implementations

+ Independently developed an HLS [code generator](https://github.com/LemonAndRabbit/u280_codegen) with a pre-defined Domain Specific Language

+ In submission to FCCM 2022

#### **Undergraduate Research Program, University of Science and Technology of China**

*2020.10 - present*

+ Advised by Prof. [Chao Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cswang/)(Associate Professor and Vice Dean at the School of Software Engieering, USTC)

+ Accelerated CNNs on FPGA boards

+ Learned various topics on Systems for Machine Learning

#### **Research on MLIR Toy**

*2020.09-2021.2*

+ Advised by Prof. [Yu Zhang]()(Associate Professor at USTC)

+ Extended the MLIR's toy project to support sparse matrix operation

+ Implemented passes to lower the toy dialect to GPU-friendly Linalg Dialect, allowing the dialect to support GPU and OpenMP
